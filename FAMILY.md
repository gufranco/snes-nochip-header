# The family standard

These sixteen repositories are one family and are held to one standard. Where
they differ, the difference must be something the hardware forces, not something
nobody got round to.

## The authority ladder

Every factual question is answered by the highest rung that has an answer, and a
lower rung never overrules a higher one.

1. **Manufacturer documentation.** Anything printed decides. Read it in full
   rather than searching it, because the passages that matter are the ones
   nobody quotes.
2. **The part's own program or the artefact itself.** A cartridge, a firmware
   image, a header. What the silicon was actually asked to do.
3. **A recording from an independent implementation**, for behaviour nobody
   documented.
4. **Nothing else.** An emulator, an FPGA core, a wiki and a forum post are rung
   3 at best and rung 4 for anything printed.

A document that contradicts itself is common. When it does, the cycle table and
the pin descriptions have both times been right and the prose wrong.

**Never calibrate against an emulator where a document exists.** A recording is
evidence about behaviour nobody wrote down. It is not evidence about a register
width, a bit name, or anything else a manufacturer printed, however many
implementations agree with it. Where a recording contradicts a document, the
document wins, the disagreement is written down, and the model follows the
document.

**A recording whose answer depends on the machine it was built on is not evidence
at all.** It is a property of the recorder, and it is excluded and named rather
than allowed to decide.

## What every repository carries

| Gate | Standard |
|:--|:--|
| Format | `ruff format --check .`, clean |
| Lint | `ruff check .`, zero findings |
| Types | `mypy` at strict plus every optional error class, zero findings |
| Tests | `<module>.test.py` beside the module, run individually |
| Coverage | 100% statement and branch, enforced, on a machine holding no artefacts |
| JSON | `pnpm run format:check`, with every submodule tree exempted |
| CI | lint, types, tests on 3.12/3.13/3.14, plus the project's own conformance job |
| Schedule | a weekly run against unpinned tools and the newest runtime, starting on ground the pipeline never reaches |
| Analysis | CodeQL and Scorecard |
| Release | semantic-release from `main`, never tagged by hand |
| Docs | README, AGENTS.md plus the one-line pointer each tool reads, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT |
| Specs | `specs/current/`, requirements with checkable scenarios |
| Hardware facts | `conformance/hardware.json`, every fact with the sentence it came from |
| Disagreements | `conformance/divergences.json`, both readings and what would settle it |

## Conventions that are not negotiable

| Thing | Rule |
|:--|:--|
| Language | Python only |
| Comments | None in source, ever. Docstrings carry the reasoning |
| Test structure | Arrange, blank line, one act, blank line, assert. No section labels |
| Nothing starts clean | Memory and registers hold what they held, from a seed |
| Artefacts | Never committed: no ROM, no firmware, no fragment of one |
| Only retail dumps | A ROM hack is somebody's edit, not what hardware ran |
| Package manager | pnpm, never npm |

## What a conformance runner must report

A runner asked about ground it has never been held to has three options and two
of them are lies. Reporting agreement lies about the part. Skipping in silence
lies about the run, because the summary then counts a comparison that never
happened. The third is to refuse: name what was compared, name what was not and
why, and count the two apart.

Report per part, never one number over parts with different evidence. One part
held to its manufacturer's manual and another held to nothing are not one figure.

## The state of this repository

Everything in the table above is in place. What the header means is held to
Nintendo's own development manual field by field; what cartridges actually
contain is measured across a library of 7,330.

**A checksum rule that was wrong on most short cartridges.** A quarter of the
retail library is not a power of two, and this package summed every byte exactly
once. Nintendo's manual says the remainder is added repeatedly until the total
reaches a power of two, and following that took the agreement with real
cartridges from 2,150 of 2,780 retail images to 2,768. The defect had survived
every internal check for as long as it existed, because all four census
properties ask the code whether it agrees with itself and a rule wrong the same
way every time passes all of them. The fix is in
[`conformance/divergences.json`](conformance/divergences.json) with both
measurements.

**Two things called a check sum.** Page 1-2-9 of the manual gives a plain sum
for the submission sheet and says outright that it is not the one in the header;
page 1-2-20 gives the real one. Reading the wrong page is how the defect above
got in, and the warning is now in three places a reader will hit before touching
the checksum.

**Twelve retail cartridges still disagree**, named in the divergence record in
three groups: competition and prototype carts that carry a checksum of zero and
never had a real one, modern re-releases whose images were rebuilt, and three
Japanese retail titles with no explanation yet. What would settle the last group
is a second dump of each from a different source.

**The census measures two different kinds of thing.** Four properties must hold
on every image and a failure is a defect. One observation, whether the computed
checksum is the one the cartridge already carries, is measured and reported
without gating, because a hack that changed content without recomputing is not a
defect here. Over the retail regions it holds on 2,768 of 2,780; over the whole
library including hacks, on 4,502 of 7,167. Those are different populations and
one number for both would be misleading.

**Nothing is claimed about timing.** This package reads and rewrites a file. It
models no part, so cycle accuracy does not apply to it and is not asserted
anywhere.
